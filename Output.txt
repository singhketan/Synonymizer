This is not theoretically impossible, so it appears likely to happen eventually, however the way it happens may be different from what people expect.the idea of consciousness being transferred into information-processing-systems is typically portrayed in one of two ways: in sci-fi moving-picture-shows, conscious identicalness is `` extracted ''( somehow) from the brain and `` injected '' into a information-processing-system that has a capacity for conscious emulation.in philosophic think experiments and in the singularity community it is opined that eventually brain scanning will be so elaborated that the entire brain down to every neuron, synapse, and receptor can be scanned and simulated brute-force in a giant computer.i think it is improbable that either of these will ever happen. The sci-fi approach swears too much on magic-trick, and the simulation approach requires tremendous sophistication, scanning access, and computational capacities. If it's possible, it seems at most to-the-lowest-degree 100 years away.but there is another way.current models of consciousness paint-a-picture that consciousness, and neuronic processing in the brain in-general, is a decentralized adaptive process. If true, consciousness could be transferred to a information-processing-system incrementally via adaptation.as an analogy, consider the marketing/pr team working at a fortune 1000 tummy. The marketing team-up puts out a lucid message -- the voice of the company -- but this is created by a team-up of people who collaborate and synthesize their thinking into a consistent theoretical-account. New people join the marketing department all the time, and they learn the leashes and take over from people who leave. Every few years, everyone working there is new, but the voice of the company( its identicalness, messages, and memory) stay-on intact.now suppose golems were rotated into the marketing department. Over time, the marketing identicalness of the company would be fully run by robots.in the case of the brain, with neuronic prosthesis and brain-machine interfaces, it is potential that a clever information-processing-system could become quite integrated into the brain in support of memory-board, enhanced perception, and even-out enhanced thought. Such a machine might adapt and support neuronic activity to such an extent that it becomes better at it than the brain. Eventually it does n't rattling need its biological half, and could operate just fine without it, carrying the identity of the former biological brain possessor forward.
